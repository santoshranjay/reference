/**
 *Five classes aid common special-purpose synchronization idioms.
 1. Semaphore is a classic concurrency tool.
 2. CountDownLatch is a very simple yet very common utility for blocking until a given number of signals, events, or conditions hold.
 3. A CyclicBarrier is a resettable multiway synchronization point useful in some styles of parallel programming.
 4. A Phaser provides a more flexible form of barrier that may be used to control phased computation among multiple threads.
 5. An Exchanger allows two threads to exchange objects at a rendezvous point, and is useful in several pipeline designs.
