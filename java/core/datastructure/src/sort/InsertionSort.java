/**
 * Algo:
 * Take one element at a time and insert it to the proper place in the left side of already sorted element list.
 * [3 4 7 1 6 8]
 * [3 4 7 1 6 8] - start from 2nd element (since 1st element, 1 array element is always sorted)
 * [3 4 7 1 6 8] - 7 not lesser than 4, break here, no need to compare further since (3,4 is already sorted and if 7 is not lesser than 4, it means it isn't lesser than 3 too)
 * [3 4 7 1 6 8] - 1 , lesser than 7 swap , next - lesser than 4 swap, next lesser than 3 swap,
 * [1 3 4 7 6 8] - 6, lesser than 7 swap, next - not lesser than 4, break here.
 * [1 3 4 6 7 8]
 * 
 * Book:
 * consider the elements one at a time, inserting each into its proper place among those already considered (keeping them sorted).
 * Unlike that of selection sort, the running time of insertion sort depends on the initial order of the items in the input.
 * For example, if the array is large and its entries are already in order (or nearly in order), then insertion sort is much, much faster than if the entries 
 * are randomly ordered or in reverse order.
 * Insertion sort uses ~N2/4 compares and ~N2/4 exchanges to sort a randomly ordered array of length N with distinct keys, on the average.
 * The worst case is ~N2/2 compares and ~N2/2 exchanges and 
 * The best case is N âˆ’ 1 compares and 0 exchanges.
