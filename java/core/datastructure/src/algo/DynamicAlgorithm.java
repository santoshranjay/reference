/*Dynamic programming is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of:

 overlapping subproblems, and
 optimal substructure.
 Optimal substructure means that you can greedily solve subproblems and combine the solutions to solve 
 the larger problem. 
 The difference between dynamic programming and greedy algorithms is that the subproblems overlap. 
 That means that by "memoizing" solutions to some subproblems, you can solve other subproblems more quickly.
